# Tradingibpy

**Running Algo-Trading Strategy using ibpy**

There are 5 files:
- main.py : it is the main loop
- ib_live_data.py : it is quite generic. You may need to change only the contract details.
- core.py : it is the main core of your strategy.
- variables.py : it has all the variables used.
- hist_time.py: it has functions which provide details for fetching historical data (used in ib_live_data.py).


*Note: it is based on 1min frequency.*


*It is only for learning pupose. I have removed the trading logic.*
